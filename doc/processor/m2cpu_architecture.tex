\section{Introduction}
The \mt{} is a simple subscalar 8-bit processor that implements the 75 
instruction \mi{}. The \mt{} and \mi{} were designed and implemented by the author
as a personal hobby project. The \ma{} is intended to be as simple as possible 
while still being interesting. Some basic information:

\begin{itemize}
\item 8-bit data and ALU buses
\item 16-bit address bus; 64KB of addressable memory
\item 256B zero-page stack
\item 75 instruction
\item implemented in VHDL on a MAX10 based development board
\end{itemize}
