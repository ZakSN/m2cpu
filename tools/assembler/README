This is a simple assembler for the m2cpu. It takes *.asm (ascii text) files as
input and generates intel format *.hex files as output. The *.hex can be used to
initialize block ram. example *.asm files are included for testing purposes.
command line opions:
-v 'verbose' spits out some debug info about symbols/tags
-o same as gcc, specificy out file, if omitted output is in a.out
-r reset vector; address that the machine code is rooted at, integer in the range 0-65535
also need to pass an input file

not super well designed, it should catch most errors, I hope.
