A very simple VHDL 8 bit cpu (plus memory), with a 16 bit address bus.
Emphasis on simplicity, hopefully still powerful enough to do some neat stuff.

I'm reading about the following cpu's as I go
	-the 6502
	-the z80
	-the machine laid out in the book "The Elements Of Computing Systems"
	 by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken
It's not compatiable with any of the above, and is signifacantly less complete

more documentation to follow.

'licence':
do whatever but please don't sue me.
